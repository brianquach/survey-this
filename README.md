## Design Reflections

##Back End
- Host RESTful API on a vitrual private server (VPS); currently chose to go with Amazon EC2 Instance. I want to research using AWS Elastic Beanstalk for easier deployment and scalability features such as load balancing. However at this
point in time, those features are not needed and setting up for a VPS will give me good practice and make switching to a different non-Amazon host easier.
